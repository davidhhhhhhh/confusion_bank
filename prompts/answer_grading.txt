## Important Notes

- If the student answer is completely blank or just says "I don't know", give encouraging feedback to try again
- For coding questions, check syntax and logic correctness
- For conceptual questions, focus on understanding rather than exact wording
- Always be supportive - remember this is for learning, not punishment
- If the question involves calculations, verify the mathematical accuracy
- Consider partial credit for answers that show some understanding even if not perfect
